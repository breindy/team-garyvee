## Coding Challenge

Prototyping one of the projects: SF Movies

### Basic project requirements and specifications:

> Create a service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San Francisco. The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.

### Technical Specs (Application Architecture)

Choose your track!

1. Full-stack :white_check_mark:
2. Front-end
3. Back-end

Little info:

- Front-end: Main focus is on making the interface as polished as possible. single page app `index.html` with external JS/CSS; demonstrate HTML/CSS skills, explore page optimizations:
- [ ] SSR (Server Side Rendering?)
- [ ] Service Workers
- [ ] File Compression

- Back-end: Minimal front-end, static view. Write document your API as if it will be used by other users. Good engineering is using the right tool for the job. Node.js, React. Keep README detailed on which code is written by you.

- Full-stack baby: client/service architecture

### Tech Stack :computer:

:white_check_mark: React

:white_check_mark: Sass

:white_check_mark: Node

:white_check_mark: Express

:white_check_mark: Heroku

### My Features

:ballot_box_with_check: Map that with pin drop that shows the different movies filmed in San Francisco.

:ballot_box_with_check: When pin drop is clicked it shows more information on the movie (using the IMDB API, you get the movie poster and the synopsis)

:ballot_box_with_check: Filter the view using autocompletion search

:ballot_box_with_check: Allow the users the store the movies that they searched as their 'like'

:ballot_box_with_check: Beautiful UI/UX

### :triangular_flag_on_post: Project Timeline Process :triangular_flag_on_post:

03/13/19 - 03/14/19

1. Read and figure out the scope of the project in my own words and intuition
2. Research the possible APIs that I need to use for the entirety of the project (google maps, imdb)
   - mapbox api or leaflet.js
   - moviedb api (for movie information)
   - SF Movie Dataset (given dataset)
3. Think of different possible things to store in my Database or making calls to the back-end
4. Mockup of possible front-end design on Sketch

:ballot_box_with_check: made simple local415 logo

:ballot_box_with_check: made basic full-stack architecture (client/server)

### Future Steps :trollface:

1. Mockup of DB Architecture (Print diagram digitally)
2. Create basic front-end architecture
3. Create basic back-end architecture and make them fully connect by running basic postman requests

4. Use possible google maps API to render a map layout on front-page
