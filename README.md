## Coding Challenge
Prototyping one of the projects: SF Movies

### Basic project requirements and specifications:
> Create a service that shows on a map where movies have been filmed in San Francisco. The user should be able to filter the view using autocompletion search.

### Technical Specs (Application Architecture)
Choose your track!
1. Full-stack :white_check_mark:
2. Front-end
3. Back-end

Little info:
- Front-end: Main focus is on making the interface as polished as possible. single page app `index.html` with external JS/CSS; demonstrate HTML/CSS skills, explore page optimizations: 
- [ ] SSR (Server Side Rendering?)
- [ ] Service Workers
- [ ] File Compression

- Back-end: Minimal front-end, static view. Write document your API as if it will be used by other users. Good engineering is using the right tool for the job. Node.js, React. Keep README detailed on which code is written by you.

- Full-stack baby: client/service architecture
